# LAB_2
This project implements a simple genetic algorithm in Python and provides an interactive Streamlit interface for visualizing evolution. The GA evolves 80-bit individuals toward a pattern with 50 ones using tournament selection, single-point crossover, and bit mutation. The repository contains both .ipynb and .py files ready for deployment.
